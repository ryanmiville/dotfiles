# Plan: Remove opencode from Brewfile

## Problem
`opencode` is listed in `packages/bundle` as a brew formula, but it's installed via native installer in `install_opencode()`. This causes `dot package list` to show it as "not installed".

## Solution
Remove `brew "opencode"` from `packages/bundle` since OpenCode is managed separately.

## Changes
- **packages/bundle**: Remove line 28 (`brew "opencode"`)

## Verification
```bash
dot package list
```
Should no longer show `opencode` in the list at all.
