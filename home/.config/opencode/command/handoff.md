description: Hand off work to a new session with targeted context

Use the handoff tool to start a new session. The goal is: $ARGUMENTS

Analyze this conversation and extract ONLY the context relevant to that goal — file paths, code snippets, decisions made, constraints discovered, current state of the work. Leave behind dead ends and anything no longer useful.
